## 🧠 Overview

**Quirkos** is a Windows application built for qualitative data exploration with a strong focus on clarity and usability. It enables researchers to work with text-based data such as interviews, open-ended surveys, and written responses in a highly visual and approachable way.

Rather than relying on complex coding panels, Quirkos represents themes as interactive visual elements. This allows users to see how ideas connect, grow, and overlap as analysis develops. The result is a more intuitive understanding of patterns within qualitative data.

Quirkos is commonly used in academic research, UX studies, social sciences, and evaluation projects. Its design supports both newcomers to qualitative analysis and experienced researchers who value a clean, focused workflow on Windows.
